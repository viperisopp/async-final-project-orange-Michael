## Dataset
[World Bank World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

 I wanted to do a data analysis project on the economic clash between the United States and China. Specifically, I wanted to investigate how a country's infrastructure impacts its economic well being. Using data about the growth of an economy (due to infra) using indicators from the world bank, I can predict how China and the USAâ€™s infrastructure policies impact their economies.

- [ ] Question 9: As urbanization increases, does the productivity of each worker increase as well?
  - Answer: While China's urbanization and worker productivity increased proportionally, I don't think they're correlated due to the US's worker productvity increasing while it's urbanization remained stagnant
